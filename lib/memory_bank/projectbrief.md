# Project Brief: Linux Remote Biometric Unlocker

This project aims to create a system that allows a user to unlock their Linux desktop, authorize `sudo` commands, and remotely start their computer using biometric authentication (fingerprint or FaceID) from their smartphone. The functionality should be similar to the "Unlock with Apple Watch" feature available for macOS, with the added capability of Wake-on-LAN.
