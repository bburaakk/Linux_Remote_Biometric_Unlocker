# Project Brief: Linux Remote Biometric Unlocker

This project aims to create a system that allows a user to unlock their Linux desktop or authorize `sudo` commands remotely using biometric authentication (fingerprint or FaceID) from their smartphone. The functionality should be similar to the "Unlock with Apple Watch" feature available for macOS.
